UnboreMe: Spark Your Curiosity (This is my first website!)
Welcome to UnboreMe, a website I built to help you combat boredom and discover exciting new hobbies!  This is my first attempt at building a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so it might not be perfectly responsive across all devices yet.

How to set up :
1. create a new folder
2. In that folder make a folder names images and put all the images in that folder
3. Save all other html and css files in the new folder only.
4. Open the welcome html file
